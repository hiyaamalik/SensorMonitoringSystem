## üåê Overview

**SensorSync** is a full-stack, web-based platform designed to monitor environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in real-time. It addresses the critical need in scientific and research institutions for a system that not only provides live data but also ensures data integrity, security, and traceability.

The project bridges the gap between raw sensor data and meaningful, verified insights. It provides a complete end-to-end pipeline‚Äîfrom sensor data collection and secure transmission to centralized storage, real-time visualization, historical analysis, and verifiable report generation. The system is built from the ground up with a focus on usability, modularity, and robust security, eliminating reliance on third-party commercial platforms and giving institutions full control over their data infrastructure.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In scientific settings like CSIR-NPL, environmental monitoring systems are crucial for research, calibration, and safety. However, existing solutions often lack the transparency, full-stack control, and rigorous data validation required for institutional use. Commercial platforms can be black boxes, and custom solutions are often underdeveloped, missing key features like secure multi-user access, real-time fault detection, and auditable data trails.

SensorSync was initiated to address this gap by developing a modular, institution-grade dashboard that supports:
-   Seamless environmental data acquisition.
-   Centralized, secure storage.
-   User-centric visualization and analytics.
-   Strict authentication protocols.
-   Trustworthy, verifiable data exports.

## ‚ú® Key Features

SensorSync is packed with features designed for robust monitoring and data management:

#### 1. **Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access (RBAC)**
-   **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and password recovery.
-   **Custom CAPTCHA:** An in-house, accessible CAPTCHA system to prevent automated registrations.
-   **Role-Based Access:** Two distinct roles (**Standard User** and **Administrator**) with different permissions. Admins have access to user management, sensor configuration, and system-wide settings.

#### 2. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**
-   **Live Data Feeds:** Dashboard cards display the latest temperature and humidity readings, auto-refreshing every few seconds.
-   **Dynamic Charts:** Live-updating line, bar, and area charts for visualizing real-time environmental trends for each sensor.
-   **Sensor Selection:** Easily switch between different sensors to monitor specific locations.

#### 3. **Historical Data & Reporting**
-   **Date Range Filtering:** Query and visualize historical data by selecting specific date ranges.
-   **Tabular & Graphical Views:** View historical data in both a paginated table and interactive charts.
-   **Secure Report Generation:** Download filtered data as an **Excel (.xlsx)** file for offline analysis or archiving.

#### 4. **Cryptographic Data Validation**
-   **Hash-Based Integrity:** Each downloaded report is accompanied by a metadata file containing a **SHA-256 hash** of its contents.
-   **Verification Module:** A dedicated page allows users to upload a report to verify its authenticity. The system re-computes the hash and compares it to the original, instantly detecting any tampering or corruption.

#### 5. **Advanced Analytics & Visualization**
-   **Geospatial Map View:** A map displays the geographical location of all deployed sensors, with color-coded markers (Green for Active, Red for Inactive) indicating their real-time status.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** An analysis page provides key statistics for any selected day, including min/max values, average, variance, and rate of change for temperature and humidity.

#### 6. **Comprehensive Admin Controls**
-   **User Management:** Admins can add, edit, delete, and manage user roles through a centralized interface.
-   **Sensor Management:** Admins can register new sensors, edit their metadata (e.g., model, accuracy, location), and view detailed information for all sensors in the network.
-   **Sensor Fault Detection:** The system automatically monitors sensor activity and flags any sensor that becomes inactive, alerting administrators on the dashboard and map.

#### 7. **Secure Profile Management**
-   **OTP Verification:** User profile updates (like changing an email address) are secured with a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to the user's registered email, preventing unauthorized changes.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

SensorSync uses a decoupled architecture where the frontend (React) communicates with a backend powered by Supabase and custom PHP scripts.

1.  **Sensors:** Physical sensors collect temperature and humidity data.
2.  **Data Ingestion:** Data is sent to a central **PostgreSQL** database managed by **Supabase**.
3.  **Backend Logic:**
    -   **Supabase** handles core database operations, real-time data streaming, and user authentication (issuing JWTs).
    -   **PHP scripts** handle specialized tasks like sending OTP emails, generating hashed Excel reports, and creating metadata files.
4.  **Frontend (React):**
    -   The single-page application built with React consumes data from the backend.
    -   It uses Supabase's real-time subscription to update the dashboard live.
    -   All user interactions, from viewing data to managing users, are handled through the React UI.
5.  **User Interaction:** Users log in, view dashboards, query data, and download reports. Admins access additional management panels.

## üîí Security Features

Security was a top priority throughout the development of SensorSync.

-   **JWT-Based Authentication:** Secure session management using JSON Web Tokens provided by Supabase Auth.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strictly enforces user roles (admin vs. user) to protect sensitive functionalities.
-   **Custom CAPTCHA:** Prevents automated bots from creating accounts.
-   **OTP for Profile Updates:** Secures changes to critical user information like email addresses.
-   **Cryptographic Hash Validation:** Guarantees the integrity and authenticity of all downloaded data reports using SHA-256 hashing.
-   **Protected Routes:** Frontend routes are protected, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
-   **Input Validation:** Both client-side and server-side validation to prevent malicious data entry.

## üß† Challenges and Lessons Learned

-   **Real-Time Data Integrity:** Ensuring a consistent and reliable data flow from physical sensors was a major challenge. We implemented fault-detection logic to handle network disruptions and flag inactive sensors.
-   **Secure OTP Implementation:** Building a secure and user-friendly OTP system required careful handling of asynchronous operations, token expiry, and prevention of bypass attempts.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Maintaining a responsive UI with continuously updating charts required optimizing data streams and component rendering to prevent performance bottlenecks.
-   **Team Collaboration:** Coordinating between teams working on hardware, backend, and frontend required strong version control practices (Git) and clear communication to keep schemas and APIs in sync.

## üöÄ Future Scope

SensorSync is a strong foundation with vast potential for future enhancements:
-   **Mobile Application:** A dedicated mobile app for on-the-go monitoring, push notifications for alerts, and offline capabilities.
-   **AI & Predictive Analytics:** Integrate machine learning models (e.g., LSTM) for time-series forecasting to predict environmental changes and detect anomalies.
-   **Self-Healing Data Module:** A system to automatically identify and interpolate missing data points caused by sensor faults, with confidence scores for transparency.
-   **Expanded Sensor Support:** Add support for a wider range of environmental parameters (e.g., air pressure, CO2, ambient noise).
-   **Advanced Admin Analytics:** Detailed usage analytics, sensor uptime reports, and user activity logs to help administrators optimize the system.
